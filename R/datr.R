#' datr: Interface with the Dat p2p network
#'
#' The datr package provides R users with a way to interface with
#' the Dat p2p network. Basic functionality includes cloning folders hosted on
#' the network, sharing your own files, downloading just metadata and
#' retrieving parts of datasets. Additional functionality specific to R is
#' likely to be implemented in due time.
#'
#' The Dat system calls have a lot of interactive aspects to them and
#' continuous synchronisation, that Rstudio does not handle well. Please
#' take this into account while using the package.
#'
#' Suggestions for improvements or bug reports always welcome at
