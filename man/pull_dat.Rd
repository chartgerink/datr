\description{
Function to keep updating a Dat folder. This function only receives
updates and does not send changes back. In other words, this is what you
need most often for other people's Dat links.
}
\details{
Note that this function does not exit until you tell R to. Rstudio does
not really like this kind of functionality, but from a terminal you will
see more plus the way to quit.
