The goal of datr is to provide R users with an easy way to interact with the [Dat](https://datproject.org) p2p infrastructure. Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. If you are having issues, please check out the [Known Issues](#known-issues) below.

## Installation

You can install `datr` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("libscie/datr")
```

See below for [Windows](#windows), [Mac](#mac), and [Linux](#linux) specific instructions for installing Dat. `v0.1.0` will be submitted to CRAN (almost done üèÅ)!

### Windows

Fire up `R` *with* Administrator privileges by right clicking the icon and selecting "Run as administrator"

[![Run as administrator](assets/run-as-admin.png)](https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-run-an-app-as-administrator-in-windows-10/)

Once the program launches, run `datr::dat_install()`. The package then initiates downloading Dat and installs it on your local machine. 

Upon completion, reboot R and you can start using the package üòª (adminstrator privileges no longer needed)

### Mac

```R
devtools::install_github('libscie/datr', ref = 'install')
datr::dat_install(os = 'macos')
```

Note that there currently is an issue out that could benefit from feedback on installation on Mac (#7).

### Linux

Run `datr::dat_install(os = 'linux')` from your R console. There's no need to specify which flavor of Linux you're running, but you might to need to restart your R session üôã

## Example

All functions that interface with the Dat network follow the semantics of `operation_dat()` (e.g., `install_dat` installs an R package from the provided Dat url). Some example code:

```R
datr::dat_install(os = 'linux')

datr::clone_dat('dat://0286381d95864386a83aadb136a60c1d09d079c5a4ff0e403fa126644ba4c6ab',
 dir = '~/test-datr/')

dir.create('~/test-datr-sharing')
setwd('~/test-datr-sharing')

datr::create_dat()

write.csv(data.frame(x = rnorm(100, 0, 1), y = rnorm(100, 50, 23)),
 '~/test-datr-sharing/test-data.csv',
 row.names = FALSE)

datr::sync_dat()
```

And in GIF form (because everything is nicer in GIFs)

## Roadmap

### v0.1.0

- [ ] Install Dat on your machine
- [x] Basic functionality of Dat
- [x] Install R packages hosted on Dat
