Description: The datr package provides R users with a way to interface with 
    the Dat p2p network. Basic functionality includes cloning folders hosted on
    the network, sharing your own files, downloading just metadata and 
    retrieving parts of datasets. Additional functionality specific to R is 
    likely to be implemented in due time.
