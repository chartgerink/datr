install_mac()
}

Nothing. Prints terminal output.

\description{
In order to install Dat, npm needs to be available on the system call. 
This becomes available when nodeJS (\url{https://nodejs.org}) is available.
Using Brew (\url{https://brew.sh/}), this function installs node.
}
\details{
The function wraps a system call that gets an install script and uses Ruby
to install it.
